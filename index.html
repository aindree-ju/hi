        **A Tapestry of Time**  
        
        Beneath the sky, so vast, so wide,  
        Where dreams and whispers often hide,  
        A tale unfolds, both deep and free,  
        A woven dance of eternity.  
        
        The sun ascends in golden hue,  
        A promise born, each day anew.  
        Its rays cascade, a warm embrace,  
        Illuminating every face.

        The rivers carve through ancient stone,  
        Their murmurs sing of lands unknown.  
        In ripples soft, their secrets glide,  
        A mirror to the world outside.  
        
        The trees stand tall, with roots so deep,  
        Their wisdom earned in silent sleep.  
        They hold the tales of storms and spring,  
        And cradle birds with songs to sing.  
        
        The winds arise, a voice untamed,  
        A herald none could ever claim.  
        It whispers through the fields of grain,  
        And soothes the heart, and heals the pain.  
        
        The stars alight the velvet night,  
        A cosmic dance, a boundless flight.  
        Their glimmers paint the skies with dreams,  
        A canvas vast, with endless schemes.  
        
        The seasons turn in measured stride,  
        Their rhythms time could not divide.  
        From winter's hush to summer's blaze,  
        Each chapter forms life's fleeting maze.  
        
        And we, but threads within this loom,  
        Both light and shadow, birth and tomb.  
        Each step we take, a fleeting chance,  
        To join the universal dance.  
        
        In laughter's spark, in tear's refrain,  
        In love that soothes and dulls the pain,  
        We find our place, our fleeting spark,  
        A glow that lingers in the dark.  
        
        So let us weave, with heart and hand,  
        A tapestry both vast and grand.  
        For time is but a fleeting stream,  
        And life, a fragile, fleeting dream.
